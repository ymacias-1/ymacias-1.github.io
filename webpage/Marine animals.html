        <h2>What Disney Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' got right about Clownfish</h2>
        <p>
            In the scene where Marlin has to go through jellyfish, Marlin was okay because he is a Ocellaris clownfish. 
            This type of clownfish lives in sea aneonmes. Jellyfish are in the same phylum as sea anenomes. The layer of mucus 
            on a clownfish that protects it from sea anenomes could have protected Marlin from the jellyfish!
