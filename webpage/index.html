            This webpage contains images of <span class=cute>cute animals</span>, at least in my opinion. You will find links to three 
            different categories: dogs, marine animals, and birds. Besides the images, each one contains some random 
            information, including jokes, fun facts, related to the animals! Enjoy!

            A key point to make!
            Human activities affect marine life and marine habitats through overfishing, pollution, acidification and the introduction of invasive species. 
            These impact marine ecosystems and food webs and may result in consequences as yet unrecognised for the biodiversity and continuation of marine life forms.
            Read more about human impact on marine life <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_marine_life'>here</a>
